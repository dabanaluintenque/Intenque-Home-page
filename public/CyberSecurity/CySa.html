                <h3> Explain Assessment Scope Considerations</h3>
                <b>Vulnerability scanner: </b> is a type of software that scans network hosts (client and servers) and intermediate systems 
                (routers, switchs, access points, and firewalls) for data such as patch level, security configuration and policies, network shares,
                unused accounts, weak passwords, rogue devices, antivirus configuration, and so on. 
                <p>
                    <b>Noncredentialed scans</b><br>
                    Are simple to implement, produce a relatively low impact on the device, and provide insight regarding what vulnerabilities are 
                    discoverable to non-authenticated users, for <b>Example</b>, someone with access to the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Credentialed scans</b><br>
                    Provide the most comprehensive evaluation of devices. By authenticating to the device, the scanner can enumerate all installed 
                    software, the file system, configuration data, user account, and many other attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Agentless scans</b><br>
                    Can be the simplest to implement, as the scanner can collect information from endpoints using protocols such as ssh, WMI,, or SNMP.
                    Some organizations do not allow the use of WMI or SNMP in response to risks associated with these protocols. Additionally, collecting
                    data can become complicated when network firewalls are in the line of communication between the vulnerability scanner and the 
                    endpoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Agent-based scans</b><br>
                    Require the installation of small, special-purpose software utilities designed to collect information from the endpoint and pass it to the
                    vulnerability scanner. <b>The advantages</b> of agent-based scanning include improved vulnerability and host configuration data, less 
                    processing overhead on the vulnerability scanner server, and simplified communication across network firewalls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Active Scanning</b><br>
                    Directly interacting with a device or software to identify vulnerabilities. <b>Examples</b> using a vulnerability scanner, enumerating services,
                    performing banner grabbing, content enumeration, or using a web application scanner such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Passive Scanning</b><br>
                    Describes methods used to identify vulnerabilities without direct interaction with a device or software. <b>Example: </b> Network packet 
                    capture.
