            <h3>Network Data Transmission</h3>
            <p><b>Copper Cable</b><br>
                Copper Cable is used to transmit electrical signals. The cable between two nodes creates a low voltage electrical circui betwwen the interfaces on the nodes.
                <b>There are two main types of copper cabel:</b> twisted pair and coaxial (coax). <b>Copper cable</b> suffers from high attenuation, 
                meaning that the signal quickly loses strength over long links. <b>Twisted pair cable</b> is rated to Category (Cat) standards. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Fiber Optic Cable</b> <br>
                Fiber Optic cable carries very high frequency radiation in the infrared light part of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
                <b>fiber optic cable supports higher bandwidth over longer links than copper cable. Fiber optic cabling is divided
                   into Single Mode (SMF) and MultiMode (MMF) types,
                </b> 
                MMF is categorized by Optical Mode designations (OM1, OM2, OM3, and OM4).

            <h3>Ethernet Standards / Media Access Control and Collision domains</h3>
             <b>Ethernet</b> is a multiple access area network, which means that the available communications capacity is shared betwwen 
             the nodes that are connected to the same media. <br>
             <b>Ethernet uses</b> a contention-based MAC system. Each network node connected to the same media is in the same <b>Collision 
                domain.
             </b> When two nodes transmit at the same time, the signals are said to collide and neither signal can reach its destination. <br>
             The Ethernet protocol governing contention and media access <b>is called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
             (CSMA/CD).
             </b> <br>
             <b>The collision detection mechanism means that</b> only half-duplex transmisions is possible. <br>
             <b>In the 10BASE-T wiring topology</b> each node is cabled to an Ethernet hub. The 10BASE-T standard dates from 1990.

            <h3>100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet Standard</h3>
            <b>The Fast Ethernet standard users the </b> The same CSMA/CD protocol as 10BASE-T. <br>
            100BASE-TX refers to Fast ethernet working over Cat 5 ( or better) twisted pair copper cable with a maximum 
            supported link lenght of 100 meters (328 feet).
