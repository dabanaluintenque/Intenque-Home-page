                        Imagine we have multipe implementations of the same function.

                <h3>Why Cares about Big O notation?</h3>
                <section>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs</li>
                        <li>Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches</li>
                        <li>When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the 
                            code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
                        </li>
                        <li>It comes up in technical interivews!</li>

                        Suppose we want to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to 
                        n (including n);
                    </p>

                        <p>Example #1</p>

                    <h3>Before we dicide which one is better first we have to understand what does better mean?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Faster?</li>
                        <li>Less memory-intensive?</li>
                        <li>More readable?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All of the above is important but we will focus on faster. (The time that it's take to run a code)</p>
                    <div>
                        <p>We can use the JavaScript built in function "performance.now()" to check the time but is not the most releable
                            way to determine the faster code.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here is the example of using performance.now with our two examples above</p>
