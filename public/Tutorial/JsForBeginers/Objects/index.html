    <!--<h3>It is a beautiful day to save lives, one brain at a time! </h3>
    <Jannah>Hi Dabana, It's Jannah. I hope you are having an absolutely fantastic, beautiful and wonderful day. <br>
    I had an amazing day today and helped a lot of people become stronger and more confident during my kickboxing class. 
    I am starting to love life more and more each day, especially because I am surrounded by amazing people, like yourself. 
    You are a blessing that I did not know I needed. I am very thankful and grateful and special to have a partner like you in my life. 
    I hope the moon smiles back at you by guiding you with the light you chace during your unlit times. The sun shined at me through your eyes, 
    allowing me to see the beuaty of life through your birght visions. I want to let you know that the stars wish they could reach the places you go, 
    to shine the way you beam. 
    I want to tell you the mountains spoke of your strength and stability, hoping they could have a fraction of how grounded you carry yourself to be. 
    The ocean spoke to me during the night tides, unable to understand the depth of your heart compared to its mysterious waves. 
    The soil that grew the little seeds of hope into the jasmine tree, used your speech as courage, wisdom and guidance to fertilize its seed. 
    Dabana, 
    It seems like you are what my world desires to be. 
    Your character and personality. 
    With that in mind, it seems imposible to try and find whats right to gift you, 
    to show you my love.  
    But I know, 
    I can be 
    your Heaven, 
    and gift you love 
    to eternity. 

    -J
     </Jannah> -->



    <p>NOTE: comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.</p>




    <div>
        <p id="example1">What is an object? (press submit to see answer)</p>

        <button onclick="answer()">submit</button>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> We can create a method inside an object, to display any information.</p>

        <p id="example2"></p>

        <button onclick="getInfo()">submit</button>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2><b>What is this keyword?</b></h2>
        <section> this refers to an object in JavaScript!</section>
        <section>It depends on how this is being used or called.</section>
        <section>IN AN OBJECtT METHOD: this refers to the object. </section>
        <section>ALONE: this refers to the global object.</section>
        <section>IN A FUNCTION: this refers to the global object.</section>
        <section>IN AN EVENT: this refers to the element that received the event.</section>

        <b>Note:</b><br>
        All JavaScript values, except primitives, are Objects.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><b>What is a Primitive Value?</b></h2>
        <p>
            <d>A primitive value</d> is a value that has no properties or methods.
        </p>
        <b>Example:</b><br>
        <strong>PI (3.14) is a primitive value.</strong><br>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><b>What is a primitive data type?</b></h2>
        <p>
            <d>A primitive data type</d> is data that has a primitive value.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types</p>
        <ul>
            <li>string</li>
            <li>number</li>
            <li>boolean</li>
            <li>null</li>
            <li>undefined</li>
            <li>symbol</li>
            <li>bigint</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Note:</b>
        <p>
            <d>Objects</d> are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
        </p>
        <p><b>Objects values are: </b> written as <d>name: value</d> pairs (name and value separated by a colon).</p>
        <p><strong>Object is</strong> a collection of named values</p>
        <p>It is a common practice to <b>declare</b> objects with the <b>const</b> <strong>keyword.</strong></p>

        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <strong>
            const student = { <br>

            name: <d>'Dabana Intenque',</d> <br>
            age: <d>23,</d> <br>
            id: <d>007713,</d><br>
            fullIdentity: <d>function(){<br>
                return this.name +" "+ this.age +" "+ this.id;<br>

                } </d> <br>
            };<br>
        </strong>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> <b>What is an Object Methods?</b></h2>
        <p>
            <d>An object method</d> is an object property containing a <d>function definition.</d>
        </p>
        <p>Methods are <d>actions</d> that can be performed on objets.</p>
        <p><b>Object properties can be</b> both primitive values, other objects, and functions.</p>

        <b>Example:</b>
        <table>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <tr>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>Dabana Intenque</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>age</td>
                <td>23</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>id</td>
                <td>007713</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>fullIdentity</td>
                <td>function(){return this.name +" "+ this.age +" "+ this.id</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Objects are Mutable</h2>
        <p>They are addressed by reference, not by value</p>
        <p>If student is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of student</p>
        <p>
            <d>const firstStudent</d> = student;
        </p>
        <b>Things to keep in mind</b>
        <p>The object <b>firstStudent</b> is not a <strong>copy</strong> of <strong>student</strong>. It is student.
            Both firstStudent and student are the same.</p>
        <p>Any changes to firstStudent will also change student, because firstStudent and student are the same object.
        </p>

        <b>Example:</b><br>
        <form>
            <p id="example3"></p>

            <label>name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="id1" placeholder="Dabana"><br><br>
            <label>age:</label>
            <input type="number" id="id2" placeholder="23"><br><br>
            <label>Id:</label>
            <input type="number" id="id3" placeholder="007713"><br><br>
            <p>
                <d>Assigning const firstStudent = student</d><br>
                <strong>firstStudent.name box will override the name.</strong>
            </p>

            <label>firstStudent.name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="id4" placeholder="any Name"><br><br>
            <input type="button" onclick="mutableObject()" value="Click">
            <input type="reset">


        </form>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Syntax for accessing Accessing Object Properties</h2>

        <p>objectName.property // <d>Ex: student.name</d>
        </p>
        or
        <p>objectName["property"] // <d>Ex: student["name"]</d>
        </p>
        or
        <p>objectName[expression] // <d>Ex: z = "age"; student[z]</d>
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2> Adding New Properties</h2>

        <p>We can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value</p>
        <p>Assume that the student object already exists we can then give it new proprertie:

        </p>
        <b>Syntax:</b><br>
        student.newProperty = "newValue";<br>

        <b>Example:</b><br>

        <p>
            <d>Add student email address in the existing student Object:</d>
        </p>

        <p><strong>To see the full result fill out the field above in the Mutable section.</strong></p>

        <from>
            <p id="example4"></p>

            <label>email:</label>
            <input type="eamil" id="id5" placeholder="dintenque@gmail.com"><br><br>
            <input type="button" onclick="addNewProperty()" value="Add new Proverty">
            <input type="reset">
        </from>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Deleting Properties</h2>
        Use <b>delete </b> keyword to delete the property from an object.
        <p>Assume that the student object already exists we can then delete any property inside of it.</p>
        <p><b>Syntax:</b></p>

        <strong>delete student.Id;</strong>


        <p> <b>Note:</b><br><b>delete</b> keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself</p>
        After, deletion the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
        <p><b>delete</b> operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or
            functions.</p>
        <p><b>The delete</b> operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your
            application.</p>
