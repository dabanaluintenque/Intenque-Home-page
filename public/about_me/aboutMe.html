                        I am an honor student major in computer science minor in mathematics, 
                        statistics, and African studies.

                        I am a highly motivated student. I like to read and discover new things all the time.
                        I like to work hard every day and share anything I learned with my colleagues in the class.
                        Everyone in my community knows me because I believe that when you know 
                        something, you should not keep it to yourself,
                        you should share it with someone else because you never 
                        know when you will need that person to help you.
                        That is why I believe in the power of sharing anything.

                        I am a math tutor. I love to help students in my community.
                        Being a tutor is a way of giving back to my community what I have learned.
                        Another is being Vice President for Student Affairs & Enrollment Management 
                        student Advisory Boar, Honor Ambasador, and TTC Teaching Technology Center JOMO Ambasador.
                        Being the voice for my community. Discuss the well-being of 
                        my community helping the community matter to me.
