                        I am a highly motivated student. I like to read and discover new things all the time.
                        I like to work hard every day and share anything I learned with my colleagues in the class.
                        Everyone in my community knows me because I believe that when you know something, you should not keep it to yourself,
                        you should share it with someone else because you never know when you will need that person to help you.
                        That is why I believe in the power of sharing anything.

                        Being a tutor is a way of giving back to my community what I have learned.

                        Being the voice for my community. Discuss the well-being of my community helping the community matter to me.
